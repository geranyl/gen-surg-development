      "content": "\n\n# Local Anaesthetics #\n\nThere are two classes of local anaesthetics: esters and amides.  Both classes do not work well in acidic tissue (i.e. inflamed tissue).  Locals are lipophilic and lipid IV is used to treat systemic toxicity. Only unbound fractions are active. Note that amides are used more frequently as they cause fewer allergic reactions than esters.\n\nBlocking of sensation occurs in order of: autonomic > pain > temperature > touch > deep pressure > motor. Sensation comes back in reverse order.\n \n\n## Amides ##\n\n1. Work by blocking Na^+^ channels\n2. Metabolized by the liver\n3.

Both intrinsic and extrinsic function is required for in vivo hemostasis. These pathways converge into a common pathway and require the presence of Ca^2+.\n\n|Pathway\t| Factors\t| Testing\t| Description\t|\n| ------\t| ------\t| ------\t|   ------\t|\n| **Intrinsic**\t| 12, 11, 9, 8\t| PTT/aPTT\t| <li>initiated by contact with abnormal/foreign surfaces <li>slower (2-6 min) than extrinsic\t|  \n| **Extrinsic**\t| 7\t| PT, INR\t| <li>initiated by tissue damage (exposure of tissue factor) <li>faster (15-20 sec) than intrinsic\t|  \n| **Common**\t| 10, 5, 2 (thrombin), 1 (fibrin)\t| measured as a part of PTT/PT\t| <li> formation of insoluble fibrin which is then cross-linked by factor 13 (fibrin + platelets = clot)  \n| \n\n### Control of Blood Clotting ###\nThere are three groups of agents used to modify thrombus formation:\n<ol>\n<li>anticoagulants - parenteral (heparin, LMWH), oral (warfarin, newer agents): used to prevent progression of clot formation\n<li>fibrinolytic agents: used to eliminate existing clots\n<li>anti-platelet agents: used to prevent initial clot formation\n</ol>\n\n####  Heparin  ####\n* binds to antithrombin and increases the rate it inhibits coagulation factors Xa and IIa\n* therapeutic aPTT achieved in 24 hours\n* route of delivery: IV/SC\n* reversal agent: protamine sulfate (1 mg protamine : 100 units heparin)\n* ~ 0.5% risk of HIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia): platelets decrease to &lt; 50% of pretreatment value within 5-10 days after starting heparin\n\t* 4Ts score for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia: **t**hrombocytopenia, **t**iming of platelet count fall, **t**hrombosis, other causes for **t**hrombocytopenia\n\t* if previously exposed to heparin, platelet fall can occur with 24 hours\n\n#### Warfarin ####\n* vitamin K antagonist\n* requires monitoring of therapeutic index and has many drug-drug interactions\n* &downarrow; amount and function of vit K dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X \n* &downarrow; vit K dependent anticoagulant proteins C and S\n* effects start at 24-36 hrs, therapeutic dose (INR 2.0-3.0) achieved in 5 days\n* route of delivery: oral\n* reversal agent: oral phytonadione (vitamin K~1) - reestablishment of normal clotting factor activity in 24-48 hrs. Faster reversal with FFP and IV infusion of vitamin K.\n* surgery: stop 5 days prior\n\n#### New Oral Anticoagulants ####\nUnlike warfarin, the new (direct) oral anticoagulants do not require monitoring of therapeutic levels and onset is quicker (between 1-3 hrs). \n\n|Drug\t| Target\t| Reversible\t|  Surgery<br/>(# of hrs to stop prior to) |\n| :------\t| :------\t| :------\t| :------  \t| \n|Xarelto (rivaroxiban)\t|  Xa\t|  No\t| 24 |\n|Savaysa (edoxaban)| Xa | No |24|\n|Eliquis (apixaban) |Xa |No|48|\n|Pradaxa (dabigatran)| IIa (thrombin)| Yes (idarucizumab)| 48 |\n\nSee Thrombosis Canada for up to date guidelines and tools: [http://thrombosiscanada.ca/tools/](http://thrombosiscanada.ca/tools/)\n\n#### Fibrinolytics ####\n* three classes of fibrinolytic drugs: tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase (SK), and urokinase (UK)\n* used for acute treatment of thrombosis e.g. tPA within the first 2 hours of MI\n\n #### Anti-platelet ####\n* reduction of platelet recruitment and activation\n\t* aspirin: irreversible COX-1 inhibitor\n\t* Plavix (clopidogrel): irreversible P2Y~12 inhibitor\n* prevention of platelet aggregation: GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban)",

Fever may or may not be present since antipyretics are more commonly used now compared to when the 5Ws were created in the 1980s.\n\n1. **W**aves (ECG)\n2. **W**ind (pneumonia)\n3. **W**ater (UTI)\n4. **W**ound (sSSI, dSSI, IV site infections - i.e. phlebitis)\n5. **W**alking (VTE)\n\n### Timeline of Common Complications ###\n* POD #0 - MI\n* POD #1 - pneumonia\n* POD #3 - pneumonia and UTI\n* POD #4 - #30 - wound\n\nMIs are the most common complication for POD #0, but more MIs occur on POD #1 and #2.\n\nAtelectasis was considered the cause of POD #1 fever but recent data shows that the relationship between atelectasis and fever does not hold true.\n\nTachycardia (possibly A-fib) on POD #3-4 after a bowel anastomosis is a sign of a leak (impending sepsis).  \n\nKeep a high index of suspicion for the outpatient who had surgery 3-4 wks prior for VTE and UTI. VTEs are not as common with the revised 5Ws due to modern use of anticoagulants postoperatively.\n\n<small>*J. of Surg Edu 2015 Vol 72(3):430-437;  J. of Surg Edu 2015 Vol 72(1):164-169</small>\n\n\n## Expected Postoperative Changes ##\n* Fluid shifts - remobilization of sequestered fluid (\"third spacing\") to intravascular compartment (may see diuresis and wt loss) typically on POD #3\n* Ileus - physiological \"stunning\" of the gut post abdominal surgery that resolves by POD #2-#3; Hypokalemia is a common cause. Persistent ileum is a complication termed postoperative adynamic ileus or paralytic ileus\n\t* order of physiological ileus recovery: \n\t\t* small bowel 24 h\n\t\t* colon 24-48 h\n\t\t* gastric 48-72 h\n\t* note that use of narcotics may extend physiological stunning.\n* SIADH - stress of surgery results in increased ADH secretion; typically self limited to a few days - weeks\n* Urinary retention - pelvic surgery (e.g. C-section with epidural) can cause retention; should resolve in 4-8 hours\n\t* urinary incontinence is a sign of retention\n\t* can use ultrasound to check for retention\n\t* measure urine output in the first 15 minutes of in-out catheterization - if >400 mL should place a catheter\n* Nausea and vomiting - due to anesthesia; should resolve in 24h\n* \"Normal\" fever - mild fever for the first 24 hours\n\t* may see a fever >38&deg;C for the first 2-3 hours post-op\n",

      "content": "\n\n# Sutures #\n\nSuture selection is based on tissue type. Considerations include how long tensile strength must be retained and how much tissue reactivity the material will cause. \nGenerally synthetic materials are less reactive and cause less tissue irritation. \n\nSutures are classified by how many filaments they have and by what material they are made of. Monofilament is less likely to harbour microbes than multifilament, but can be hard to tie securely. The material type determines how a suture breaks down. Absorbable sutures are broken down by proteolysis (natural suture materials), or hydrolysis (synthetic materials). \n\nSuture size is based on thread diameter. The large the number, the thinner the thread. E.g. 8-0 - microvascular surgery, 2-0 deep tissues like bowel.\n\nNeedles attached to suturing thread are either tapered, conventional cutting, or reverse cutting. Cutting needles should only be used with skin, all other tissue should use a tapered needle so that tissue is not torn through.\n\nSome common synthetic suture materials:\n(*fa = fully absorbed*)\n\n| Material  |  Absorbable?\t|  Retention of Tensile Strength\t| Tissue Rx\t| Use\t|  \n|  ------\t| :------:\t| ------\t| ------\t| ------\t|  \n| Demalon (nylon)\t|  N\t|  - \t|  low \t| cutaneous\t|  \n| Prolene (polypropylene)\t| N\t| -\t| low\t| cutaneous  \n| Mersilene (polyester)\t| N\t| -\t| low  \t| soft tissue (long term approximation)\t| \n| Monocryl (poliglecaprone)\t| Y\t| 50% at 1 wk, 20% at 2 wks, fa in 100d\t| minimal\t| cutaneous\n| Vicryl (lactide and glycoside)\t|Y | 60% at 2 wks, 8% at 4 wks, fa in 60-90d\t| mild-moderate (less than catgut)\t|  cutaneous (not the purple coated), soft tissue |  \n| PDS (poly p-dioxanone) \t| Y|70% at 2 wks, 50% at 4 wks, 25% at 6 wks, fa in 180d\t| minimal| soft tissue requiring extended approximation, fascia |  \n\nSome common natural materials:\n\n| Material  |  Absorbable?\t|  Retention of Tensile Strength\t| Tissue Rx\t| Use\t|  \n|  ------\t| :------:\t| ------\t| ------\t| ------\t|  \n| silk\t| N\t| 2 years\t| moderate\t| soft tissue approximation/ligation\t|  \n| catgut\t| Y\t| 7-10 days, fa 70 days\t| moderate\t| soft tissue\t|  \n| chromic gut\t| Y\t| 14 days, fa 90 days\t| moderate (< plain gut)\t|  soft tissue approximation/ligation\n\n\n\nFor more information please see [http://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/suture-materials/](http://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/suture-materials/)\n\n## General Rules ##\n\n* 3-0 or 4-0 sutures are used for skin on the torso and extremities\n* 5-0 or 6-0 sutures are used for skin on the face and neck\n* 2-0 to 4-0  sutures are used for closure of deeper tissues\n* non-absorbable sutures should be removed in:\n\t* 7-10 days - torso and extremities\n\t* 4 days - face and neck\n* cosmetic procedures use non-absorbable sutures",
