# Postoperative Concerns #

Certain changes are expected after the stress of surgery, but there are also complications to keep an eye out for.

When rounding keep on eye on: wounds, respiratory function, renal function (oliguria), hypotension, chest pain, abnormal bleeding, GI tract function, and cognitive function.


## Complications ##

* malignant hyperthermia
	* autosomal dominant disorder resulting in extreme fever due to: halogenated inhaled anesthetics, succinylcholine, extreme heat stress, vigorous exercise
	* may lead to: rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, mixed acidosis, DIC like presentation, muscle necrosis
	* treated with dantrolene 1 mg/kg rapid push up to 10 mg/kg, rapid cooling, mannitol and IVF for rahbdomyolsis, correct electrolytes
* atelectasis
	* usually seen within 48 hours; typically due to general anesthetic use
	* help prevent by quitting smoking 8 wks prior to surgery, early mobilization post-op; treat with incentive spirometry, chest physiology
* fever - see the 5Ws
* bleeding
* surgical site infections (SSI)
	* superficial (sSSI) or deep (dSSI); tachycardia may be the first sign (prior to fever); deep infections can be slower to appear and may fail to resolve after systemic treatment if not drained
* surgical wound failure
	* dehiscence is an acute mechanical failure of surgical closure involving the fascia; may see spontaneous serous fluid from wound prior to dehiscence
		* a gush of serosanguinous fluid is a herald of impending dehiscence
* delirium
	* due to drug withdrawal (e.g. alcohol), hypoxia, infection, metabolic/electrolyte disturbances, medications, etc.

## The 5Ws ##
The "5Ws" of postoperative fever were updated in 2015* to reflect the most common postoperative complications and the order in which they appear. Fever may or may not be present since antipyretics are more commonly used now compared to when the 5Ws were created in the 1980s.

1. **W**aves (ECG)
2. **W**ind (pneumonia)
3. **W**ater (UTI)
4. **W**ound (sSSI, dSSI, IV site infections - i.e. phlebitis)
5. **W**alking (VTE)

### Timeline of Common Complications ###
* POD #0 - MI
* POD #1 - pneumonia
* POD #3 - pneumonia and UTI
* POD #4 - #30 - wound

MIs are the most common complication for POD #0, but more MIs occur on POD #1 and #2.

Atelectasis was considered the cause of POD #1 fever but recent data shows that the relationship between atelectasis and fever does not hold true.

Keep a high index of suspicion for the outpatient who had surgery 3-4 wks prior for VTE and UTI. VTEs are not as common with the revised 5Ws due to modern use of anticoagulants postoperatively.

## Expected Postoperative Changes ##
* Fluid shifts - remobilization of sequestered fluid ("third spacing") to intravascular compartment (may see diuresis and wt loss) typically on POD #3
* Ileus - physiological "stunning" of the gut post abdominal surgery that resolves by POD #2-#3; Hypokalemia is a common cause. Persistent ileum is a complication termed postoperative adynamic ileus or paralytic ileus
	* order of physiological ileus recovery: 
		* small bowel 24 h
		* colon 24-48 h
		* gastric 48-72 h
	* note that use of narcotics may extend physiological stunning.
* SIADH - stress of surgery results in increased ADH secretion; typically self limited to a few days - weeks
* Urinary retention - pelvic surgery (e.g. C-section with epidural) can cause retention; should resolve in 4-8 hours
	* urinary incontinence is a sign of retention
	* can use ultrasound to check for retention
	* measure urine output in the first 15 minutes of in-out catheterization - if >400 mL should place a catheter
* Nausea and vomiting - due to anesthesia; should resolve in 24h
* "Normal" fever - mild fever for the first 24 hours
	* may see a fever >38&deg;C for the first 2-3 hours post-op
