 # Surgical Notes #

All notes should be titled with the type of note (e.g. General Surgery Consult), your designation (e.g. CC2), and have a date and time. 

Notes should end with your name, designation, pager number (if you have one), and your attending's name. Remember to sign all your notes.

Orders should *always* be reviewed by a resident/attending and signed off on.

## Postop Note ##
This note is written in the OR prior to the patient going to the recovery room. Many hospitals have routine order forms. Check for one prior to writing a generic order. Generic orders use the acronym AD DAVID 6P.
