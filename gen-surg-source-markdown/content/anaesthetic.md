# Local Anaesthetics #

There are two classes of local anaesthetics: esters and amides.  Both classes do not work well in acidic tissue (i.e. inflamed tissue).  Locals are lipophilic and lipid IV is used to treat systemic toxicity. Only unbound fractions are active. Note that amides are used more frequently as they cause fewer allergic reactions than esters.

Blocking of sensation occurs in order of: autonomic > pain > temperature > touch > deep pressure > motor. Sensation comes back in reverse order.
 

## Amides ##

1. Work by blocking Na^+^ channels
2. Metabolized by the liver
3. Compared to esters: fewer allergic reactions, last longer, distribute more widely 

| Anaesthetic	| Onset (min)	| Duration (min)	| Toxic dose (mg/kg)	|  
|  ------	| :------:	| :------:	| :------:	|  
| lidocaine (Xylocaine)	| 1	| 60-90	| 4	|  
| lidocaine with epinephrine	|1	| 120-360<br/>(2-6hrs)	| 7	|  
| bupivacaine (Marcaine)	| 5	| 120-240<br/>(2-4hrs)	| 2.5	|  
| bupivacaine with epinephrine	| 5	| 180-420<br/> (3-7hrs)	| 3  

## Toxicity ##
### Symptoms and Signs ###
* early signs: nausea, dizziness, tinnitus, perioral tingling
* later on: CNS excitement (seizures)
* even later: CNS depression (bradycardia, respiratory depression, decreased LOC), arrhythmias and/or asystole, shock

### Treatment ###
Systemic effects of local anesthesia should be treated with supportive care and **lipid** infusion (amides bind to lipids).
