*No DVT prophylaxis (patient ambulatory, low DVT/PE risk)  
Restart home meds  
Remove dressing POD#1  
Discharge home when well  
Rx on chart  
May shower POD#2

## Abbreviations Used ##
* AAT: activity as tolerated
* DAT: diet as tolerated
* CF: clear fluid
* SL IV WDW: saline lock intravenous when drinking well
* TKVO: to keep vein open
* VSR: vital signs routine 
* CSM: color, sensory, and motor - e.g. monitor left leg CSM q4h
* Rx on chart: prescription in chart
* Dx: diagnosis
* D/C: discontinue
* S/P: status post
* F/U: follow up 
* POD: post operative day

## Details ##
* **A**dmission orders
	* If the patient is to be admitted include to which service and under which doctor. Otherwise "same day home".
* **D**iagnosis
	* The diagnosis surgery was performed for.
* **D**iet
	* Specify immediate dietary need. Typically "sips/ice chips *or* clear fluids --> DAT" meaning start the patient small sips and work up to diet as tolerated.
* **A**ctivity
	* Any activity restrictions should be specified. Otherwise, AAT (activity as tolerated).
* **V**itals
	* Specify how often vitals should be monitored, and if neurovascular checks are required.
	* VSR: vital signs routine (includes HR, RR, BP, SpO~2~, and temp)
		* Usually every 8-12 hours, check what the hospital considers routine and specify desired interval if required.
* **I**V Fluids
	* Specify:
		* type of IV fluid and maintenance rate. 
		* if boluses, replacement fluids for nasogastric tubes, drains, etc. are required
		* when to discontinue IV fluids (usually "d/c when drinking well").
	* Types of IV fluid
		* Saline:
			* NS (normal saline - 0.9% NaCl) 
			* 1/2 NS (0.45% NaCl)
		* RL (Ringer's lactate)
		* Dextrose in water:
			* D5W (5% dextrose)
			* D10W (10% dextrose)
		* D5NS (5% dextrose in saline)
	* Rates
		* Adult maintenance rate usually 100-125 mL/hr.
		* Pediatrics - use 4:2:1 rule
		* TKVO - to keep vein open specified as the rate if no parenteral fluids required but IV access is required (e.g. for medications)
	* Replacement for fluid loss
		* Any addition to maintenance fluids depends on ongoing fluid losses and their composition.
			* e.g. replace NG (nasogastric) losses 1:1 with NS (normal saline) + 20 mEq/L KCl q6hrs
	* Special considerations:
		* Total body water is directly proportional to *lean muscle mass*. In frail or morbidly obese individuals maintenance rates may require adjustment.
		* Diabetic patients and individuals with pre-existing fluid balance/electrolyte problems (e.g. renal impairment, CHF) may require a different IV solution and rate than usual. Check with your attending. 
* **I**ns and Outs
	* Inputs and outputs to be monitored each shift along with targets if indicated (e.g. desired urine output rate). Drains can be included in this section.
	* Usually specified as "strict ins/outs" if close monitoring of fluids required.
	* Urine output targets (if no renal impairments):
		* adult: >0.5 mL/kg/hour (~30-50 mL/hour)
		* pediatric: >1.0 mL/kg/hour
* **I**nvestigations
	* Postop labs, cultures, and imaging.
	* Like vital signs, investigations required on a routine basis require interval specifications and when to discontinue.
* **D**rains
	* Specify type, location, and requirements for monitoring or care.
		* e.g. Drain #1: left inframammary crease Jackson Pratt to bulb suction 
* **D**ressings
	* Specify frequency of dressing changes/wound packing. 
	* If skin grafts used, specify donor locations and care type (usually "routine donor care").  
* **D**rugs (6P)
	* pain (analgesia)
	* puke (antiemetic)
	* poop - stool softener if narcotics are prescribed, bowel routine (if indicated)
	* pus (anti-inflammatories, antibiotics)
	* prophylaxis - DVT prophylaxis (anticoagulants), gastric protection (ulcer prophylaxis)
	* personal - any personal medications that should be restarted
		* if not restarting home meds, include them in the chart and write HOLD to avoid forgetting them
	* others: sedation, insulin requirements (diabetics)
* Other relevant notes for care
	* notify MD if - indications to contact the doctor (e.g. urine output < 30 cc/hr for 3 consecutive hours)
	* post-operative patient education (e.g. for new ostomy)
	* bathing restrictions
	* any inpatient referrals (e.g. PT/OT, social work)
* **D**ischarge plan 
	* follow up appointment date and doctor
	* Rx provided - specify if any take home scripts were written for the patient
	* any referrals made for outside services (e.g. CCAC wound care)
