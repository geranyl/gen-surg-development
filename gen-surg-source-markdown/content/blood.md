### Adverse Effects ###
Blood products have three main categories of adverse effects: metabolic, immune, and infectious.

* Metabolic: hyperkalemia (older PRBC), rarely hypocalcemia (citrate toxicity from FFP)
* Immune: fever, acute/delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, thrombocytopenia, anaphylaxis, urticaria, graft versus host disease (from donor WBC), immune suppression, TRALI (transfusion related acute lung reaction), TACO (transfusion associated circulatory overload)
* Infectious: bacteremia (platelets highest risk), Hepatitis B (1 in 200 thousand), Hepatitis and HIV (1 in 2 million).

##### Symptoms to Be Aware of Post Transfusion #####
* fever (increase in temp >1&deg;C), pruritus, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, respiratory distress, rales, hives, flank pain, oozing from IV sites
* acute transfusion reactions can present during or within 24 hours of transfusion - severe reactions within 15 minutes
* TRALI may present 1-2 hours post transfusion but may be delayed (up to 72 hrs) - fever, hypotension, respiratory distress
* GVHD may present 4-30 days post transfusion - fever, rash, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, profuse diarrhea, cough

## Coagulation ##
Three coagulation pathways exist: intrinsic, extrinsic, common. Both intrinsic and extrinsic function is required for in vivo hemostasis. These pathways converge into a common pathway and require the presence of Ca^2+.

|Pathway	| Factors	| Testing	| Description	|
| ------	| ------	| ------	|   ------	|
| **Intrinsic**	| 12, 11, 9, 8	| PTT/aPTT	| <li>initiated by contact with abnormal/foreign surfaces <li>slower (2-6 min) than extrinsic	|  
| **Extrinsic**	| 7	| PT, INR	| <li>initiated by tissue damage (exposure of tissue factor) <li>faster (15-20 sec) than intrinsic	|  
| **Common**	| 10, 5, 2 (thrombin), 1 (fibrin)	| measured as a part of PTT/PT	| <li> formation of insoluble fibrin which is then cross-linked by factor 13 (fibrin + platelets = clot)  
| 

### Control of Blood Clotting ###
There are three groups of agents used to modify thrombus formation:
<ol>
<li>anticoagulants - parenteral (heparin, LMWH), oral (warfarin, newer agents): used to prevent progression of clot formation
<li>fibrinolytic agents: used to eliminate existing clots
<li>anti-platelet agents: used to prevent initial clot formation
</ol>

####  Heparin  ####
* binds to antithrombin and increases the rate it inhibits coagulation factors Xa and IIa
* therapeutic aPTT achieved in 24 hours
* route of delivery: IV/SC
* reversal agent: protamine sulfate (1 mg protamine : 100 units heparin)
* ~ 0.5% risk of HIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia): platelets decrease to &lt; 50% of pretreatment value within 5-10 days after starting heparin
	* 4Ts score for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia: **t**hrombocytopenia, **t**iming of platelet count fall, **t**hrombosis, other causes for **t**hrombocytopenia
	* if previously exposed to heparin, platelet fall can occur with 24 hours

#### Warfarin ####
* vitamin K antagonist
* requires monitoring of therapeutic index and has many drug-drug interactions
* &downarrow; amount and function of vit K dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X 
* &downarrow; vit K dependent anticoagulant proteins C and S
* effects start at 24-36 hrs, therapeutic dose (INR 2.0-3.0) achieved in 5 days
* route of delivery: oral
* reversal agent: oral phytonadione (vitamin K~1) - reestablishment of normal clotting factor activity in 24-48 hrs. Faster reversal with FFP and IV infusion of vitamin K.
* surgery: stop 5 days prior

#### New Oral Anticoagulants ####
Unlike warfarin, the new (direct) oral anticoagulants do not require monitoring of therapeutic levels and onset is quicker (between 1-3 hrs). 

|Drug	| Target	| Reversible	|  Surgery<br/>(# of hrs to stop prior to) |
| :------	| :------	| :------	| :------  	| 
|Xarelto (rivaroxiban)	|  Xa	|  No	| 24 |
|Savaysa (edoxaban)| Xa | No |24|
|Eliquis (apixaban) |Xa |No|48|
|Pradaxa (dabigatran)| IIa (thrombin)| Yes (idarucizumab)| 48 |

#### Fibrinolytics ####
* three classes of fibrinolytic drugs: tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase (SK), and urokinase (UK)
* used for acute treatment of thrombosis e.g. tPA within the first 2 hours of MI

 #### Anti-platelet ####
* reduction of platelet recruitment and activation
	* aspirin: irreversible COX-1 inhibitor
	* Plavix (clopidogrel): irreversible P2Y~12 inhibitor
* prevention of platelet aggregation: GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban)
