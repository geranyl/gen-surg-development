# Writing a Consult (History and Physical) Note #
A surgical consult requires determining whether surgery is indicated, as well as determining how well a patient can tolerate surgery, how well they can recover, and whether their home environment is suitable for recovery post discharge.

* **ROS**
 
	>Aim to identify any life threatening problems e.g. MI that presented with vomiting.  
	>Focus on determining if the patient can handle the stress of surgery. Focus on respiratory, cardiac, renal, hematologic, and endocrine systems.  Ask about nutrition and appetite.

* ABGs - ill patients
* Group and screen - if surgery likely
* AXR, CXR, U/S, CT scans - if indicated
* ECG - men >40, women >50

<h3>Assessment </h3>
This is the TL;DR of the medicine world, typically written in the format of:
 
 * [Name] is a [xx] year old [sex] who has known [relevant PMHx].

* [Name] came to [service] on [date] presenting with [list most relevant HPI].

* On exam [name] was found to have [pertinent positives & negatives].

* Investigations revealed [pertinent positives & negatives].

* [May describe recent treatments, response to treatments, and present condition, if helpful].

* This patient’s presenting condition is likely the result of [list differential], [although X and Y cannot be ruled out (if applicable)].

<h3>Plan</h3>
We will admit [name] to the [service ward]. Outline plan, usually in issues-based format. If OR likely include NPO, consent, fluids, and antibiotics.
